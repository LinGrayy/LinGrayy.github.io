## 👩🏼‍💻 Experience

**Unsupervised Domain Adaptation(UDA)**  _(Jun. 2022 - Present)_ <br>
  - UDA based on adversarial Learning.
  - UDA Based on Image Translation.
  - Source-free UDA, based on pseudo-labeling and denoising self-supervised techniques.
<br><br>

**Robustness of Deep Neural Networks in Semantic Segmentation of Fluorescence Microscopy Images**  _(Mar. 2021 -- Jun. 2022.Dec)_ <br>
  - We have developed an assay that characterizes robustness of DNN models in semantic segmentation of FM images.
  - Our study reveals important differences in robustness of DNN segmentation models on natural images versus FM images.
  - Our study reveals new and fundamental robustness properties of DNN models, and reveals relations between corruption robustness and adversarial robustness.
